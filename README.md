## Lyrics

```
put a bullet in my brain
never change all i see it went away 
son is first hope caught his eye
i've always told this it all
never stay the same
so i cannot say
so i cannot say

uuu eyyy

things
i see ya got going on
fall

don't call all in all
bugger off
run it off
right the wrong
say i'm gone

01:
flame in the sun

always a thorax hold on

```
