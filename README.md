## Lyrics

```
put a bullet in my brain
never change all i see it went away 
son is first hope caught his eye
i've always told this saying to all
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
so i cannot say
so i cannot say

uuu eyyy
never stay the same

all the things
i see ya got going on
i used to sync to brink
accept all but not a fall

don't call all in all stay in fog and dust
sayin' what you got on saying you bugger off
i stay in the flame to run it off
i'm never gonna right the wrong, right your wrong


say i'm gone

01:20 flame in the sun

always a thorax hold on
our flame gotta 
got the fate is on

```
