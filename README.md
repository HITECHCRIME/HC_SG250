## Lyrics

```
put a bullet in my brain never change 
all i see it went away 
son is first hope caught his eye / it's on the first thing that caught his eye
i've always told this saying to all
some tied my rights / someone made deep cuts / 
so i cannot say
so i cannot say (it now)

(uuu eyyy)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX fold on 
something wrong all the things i see ya got going on
i some used to sync to fall-offs
accept all, except the fall / accept no fall

don't call all in all stay in fog and dust
sayin' what you got on saying you bugger off
i stay in the flame to run it off
i say i'm never right the wrong, right your wrong

symbol
it's a symbol i've given up

i say i'm gonna kill it off
let's say i'm gone

01:20 flame in the sun (aye)

always a thorax hold on
our flame gotta saying
got the fate is on

never stay the same

```
